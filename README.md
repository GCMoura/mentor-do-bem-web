# Mentor do Bem - Frontend

This project aims to promote the exchange of knowledge about technologies. The idea surged after the finished the Next Level Week from Rocketseat and the initiative of Igor Rebola on Linkedin in helping people outside the labor market to find a redeployment, on free, through the Site do Bem. 
So, Mentor do Bem intend to connect people who want to learn some technology with people who want to teach a little of your knowledge.  The way to teach and to learn is totally free. Perhaps, the distance between you and the knowledge is just one click away.
